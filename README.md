### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

By the end of this project, I learned how to create a QR code component using HTML and CSS. I also learned how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive design.

Some code snippets that I am proud of are:

```html
<title>Rajeev Kumar &mdash; QR Code Component</title>
```

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on improving my CSS skills and learn more about CSS Grid and Flexbox. I will also focus on learning JavaScript to make my projects more interactive.
